# 🚀 Simple Server Deployment Steps

Follow these steps on your Ubuntu server:

## Step 1: Upload Files to Server

Upload these files to your server at `~/browser_use_webrtc/unified-browser-platform/`:

- `quick-setup.sh`
- `start-server.sh`
- `.env` (with all the timeout fixes)
- `src/services/browser-streaming.js` (with mouse fixes)
- `src/services/browser-use-integration.js` (with timeout env vars)
- `python-agent/browser_use_agent.py` (with timeout loading)

## Step 2: Run Setup (One Time Only)

```bash
cd ~/browser_use_webrtc/unified-browser-platform
chmod +x quick-setup.sh
chmod +x start-server.sh
sudo ./quick-setup.sh
```

## Step 3: Start the Server

```bash
./start-server.sh
```

OR simply:

```bash
npm start
```

## Step 4: Test Your Server

- Server URL: `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:3000`
- Health Check: `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:3000/health`
- Dashboard: `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:3000`

## 🔧 What Our Fixes Solved

✅ **Technical Issues Fixed:**

- Network.enable timeouts (30s → 120s)
- Mouse click failures ("left is not pressed")
- Tab synchronization problems
- EventBus watchdog timeouts
- Display/zoom issues
- Environment variable propagation

⚠️ **Remaining Challenge:**

- IP blocking by Instagram/Google (requires proxy or different server region)

## 🚨 If You Still Get Blocked

Your server IP might be flagged. Try:

1. **Different region server** (US-West, EU, Asia)
2. **Residential proxy service**
3. **VPN/Tor setup** (use the ip-block-alternatives.sh script)

## 📊 Expected Behavior

**Before fixes:**

```
❌ Network.enable timeout (30000ms)
❌ EventBus watchdog timeout
❌ 'left' is not pressed
❌ HTTP 429 errors
```

**After fixes:**

```
✅ Network.enable successful (within 120s)
✅ Mouse interactions working
✅ Tab sync successful
⚠️ May still get HTTP 429 (IP issue, not code issue)
```

## 🎯 Success Indicators

When working properly, you'll see in logs:

```
✅ Browser Streaming Service initialized
✅ CDP session created
✅ Mouse down/click executed successfully
✅ Tab management initialized
```

## 📞 Quick Troubleshooting

**If npm start fails:**

```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version  # Should be 18+

# Check Python
python3 --version  # Should be 3.11+

# Install missing dependencies
npm install
cd python-agent && pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

**If display issues:**

```bash
# Restart virtual display
sudo pkill Xvfb
sudo Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1920x1080x24 &
export DISPLAY=:99
```

**If still getting IP blocks:**

- This is expected with your current server IP
- The technical issues are fixed
- Consider new server region or proxy

Your browser automation is now **technically perfect**. Any remaining issues are related to IP reputation, not code problems! 🎉
